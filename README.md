# web-design-books-demo
Fully functional responsive website I built for my Web Design class.  HTML5 and CSS3 are used.  CSS3 Grid is used for page orientation.  Website displays some of my books.

## Description
The following are the descriptions of the main features of the website:

**Body** – the background for the entire body has a color of white

**Wrapper** – the wrapper is the part of the page that contains the content. It has a background color of white and a width of 1200 pixels. 

**Header** – The image should be floated to the left with a blue border underneath. The top should have 12 pixels of padding.

**Navigation bar** – The navigation links are blue and change to dark blue when hovering. They are floated to the right of the header image. The second navigation link has a sub navigation menu that contains the books. This menu uses the same colors as the parent, but the links go down instead of across. See Video for more details.

**Main** – the main content section is inside the wrapper and should have a white background color as well as being floated to the left. The font is Geneva and the font size is 1.125em. The line height is 1.45. Set the text to justify so that it evenly expands across the page. The hyperlinks should be blue and underline when hovering.

**Image Text Area** – This area should have a font of Georgia and a width of about 800 pixels. Make the text justify.

**Footer** – the text should be a dim grey color and small in font size. There should be right borders on the side of each navigation link with some padding of .5em. The social icon images should link to their respected web pages (just use the base URL for each site). All content should be centered and the navigation links should underline when hovering. List the sub navigation links for the books under the main navigation links. You can omit the books navigation link.

**Book Details Section** – This section contains the details for each book. The background color is beige and the border is brown with 1 pixel in width. The corners should be rounded by 10 pixels (See Chapter 14 for more details). The text font is courier new. The heading is h4.

**Form** – The font type is Verdana and the size is about 250 pixels in width

**Sub Navigation Menu** – The styling is the same as the header navigation menu except the links are aligned vertically not horizontally. You will need to position this menu near the books link. See video for more details. Personally, I believe this may be the hardest part of the project. 

**Media Queries** - There are two media queries that adjust the page at smaller widths. One is up to 31ems; the other is 31.1em to 55ems in width. See video for more details.
